# Rustica OS - Bootable Image

This directory contains the bootable Rustica OS disk image that can be written to a USB drive or used for installation.

## ExitBootServices Fix Summary (2025-01)

**ISSUE**: Kernel was hanging at ExitBootServices with "memory map changed" error.

**ROOT CAUSE**: UEFI console output (`uefi::system::with_stdout`) was happening BETWEEN the final `GetMemoryMap()` call and `ExitBootServices()`. UEFI console can trigger internal allocations, which invalidates the memory map key.

**FIX**: Implemented a strict "frozen zone" - absolutely NO allocations, prints, or protocol calls between GetMemoryMap and ExitBootServices. Only raw CPU instructions and the ExitBootServices call itself are allowed in this zone.

**VERIFICATION**: After implementing the frozen zone, ExitBootServices succeeds. The UEFI console stops working after ExitBootServices (expected), but the kernel is alive and in runtime mode.

**KNOWN ISSUES**:
- Serial port I/O (COM1) causes hangs in QEMU/OVMF environment - avoid for now
- After ExitBootServices, need to use custom memory allocator (not UEFI's)
- Native console driver needs to be implemented for post-exit output

## IMPORTANT: ExitBootServices Debugging Protocol

If the kernel hangs at "Step 4: Exiting UEFI boot services", follow this protocol EXACTLY.

### Why ExitBootServices Hangs

ExitBootServices() can hang or "never return" only if one of these is true:

1. The memory map changed between GetMemoryMap() and ExitBootServices()
2. Boot services memory is accessed after exit
3. Interrupts fire with no handlers
4. Stack or heap still lives in firmware memory
5. The kernel prints/logs after exit (dead console)
6. Page tables reference invalid regions
7. A fault occurs but no handler exists → silent halt

### Debugging Protocol - Step by Step

When debugging ExitBootServices issues, implement INSTRUMENTATION ONLY. Do NOT optimize, refactor, or reorganize code.

#### 1. Add a "Hard Stop" Tracing Ladder (CRITICAL)

Implement numbered progress markers that survive without a console.

**Strategy: Use multiple independent channels**

- Serial port output (COM1 / UART base 0x3F8)
- Volatile memory counter
- CPU halt loop with unique signatures

**Example trace points:**

```
Before ExitBootServices:
  [BOOT-TRACE] 1 - About to disable interrupts
  [BOOT-TRACE] 2 - Interrupts disabled
  [BOOT-TRACE] 3 - About to get memory map

After ExitBootServices:
  [BOOT-TRACE] 4 - ExitBootServices returned
  [BOOT-TRACE] 5 - Starting runtime init
```

#### 2. Add Serial Output BEFORE and AFTER Exit

This is the single most important debugging step.

Add DIRECT serial writes (no UEFI console, no wrappers) at each stage:

- Before GetMemoryMap
- Before ExitBootServices
- Immediately after ExitBootServices
- First instruction of runtime loop

**Serial port initialization (x86_64 COM1):**
```c
// Base address: 0x3F8
// Initialize for 115200 baud, 8N1
```

**If you see serial output after exit:** The kernel did NOT hang — it lost visibility.

#### 3. Freeze the Memory Map (UEFI Classic Failure Mode)

UEFI requires:
1. GetMemoryMap()
2. ExitBootServices(map_key)
3. NOTHING may change memory between these calls

**Critical Rules:**
- Allocate memory map buffer from kernel-owned memory
- Do NOT allocate anything between GetMemoryMap and ExitBootServices
- Call GetMemoryMap() twice and compare map size and key
- Log if it changed

#### 4. Disable Interrupts BEFORE Exit

This is non-optional.

**Required sequence:**
1. Disable interrupts immediately before ExitBootServices (`cli` on x86_64)
2. Do NOT re-enable until exception handlers are installed
3. A stray interrupt = silent halt

#### 5. Verify Stack and Heap Location

Ensure:
- Stack pointer is NOT in EfiBootServicesData
- Heap is NOT firmware-backed
- Log stack address, heap base, and memory type

#### 6. Add Post-Exit Infinite Loop (Test-Only)

This is how you prove the CPU is alive.

**After ExitBootServices, temporarily:**
1. Skip ALL runtime init
2. Enter an infinite loop with:
   - CPU pause/hlt
   - Serial heartbeat every N cycles

**If this runs:** ExitBootServices succeeded.

#### 7. Install Minimal Exception Handlers Before Exit

Even a stub handler is better than none.

**Install minimal handlers before ExitBootServices:**
- Page fault
- General protection fault
- On fault: write a serial marker and halt

This prevents "silent death".

#### 8. DO NOT Print to Console After Exit

After ExitBootServices:
- Do NOT call any console output
- Do NOT log using UEFI helpers
- Assume output is unavailable

Many kernels "hang" simply because they print.

### Minimal "ExitBootServices Probe" Sequence

Implement this sequence to diagnose the hang:

```
1. disable_interrupts()
2. trace("A")  // serial - about to get memory map
3. get_memory_map()
4. trace("B")  // serial - memory map acquired
5. exit_boot_services()
6. trace("C")  // serial - exit returned
7. while (true) { cpu_pause(); serial_heartbeat(); }
```

**Interpret results:**
- See A, B but not C → exit failed (memory map or interrupts issue)
- See A, B, C → runtime is alive (issue is in later init)
- Nothing after exit → output died, not kernel

### Success Outcomes

**Outcome 1 (Best):**
- Serial shows post-exit trace
- Infinite loop runs
- → ExitBootServices is working

**Outcome 2:**
- Serial stops before exit
- → Memory map or interrupts are wrong

**Outcome 3:**
- Immediate reboot or freeze
- → Exception with no handler

### Image Build Requirements (DO NOT CHANGE)

When creating disk images, maintain these invariants:

1. **GPT disk image** (not raw FAT)
2. **EFI System Partition:**
   - FAT32
   - ≥ 100MB (prefer 200–512MB)
   - Required path: `/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI`
   - Correct PE/COFF format
   - Correct target architecture (amd64 only for now)
3. **Proper component separation:**
   - Bootloader: EFI-only, minimal
   - Kernel: loaded by bootloader at `/EFI/Rustux/kernel.efi`
   - EFI CLI: debug-only scaffold
   - Runtime: NOT active until explicitly tested

4. **Boot flow must be exactly:**
   ```
   UEFI firmware → BOOTX64.EFI → load Rustux kernel → kernel entry → EFI CLI (debug)
   ```

5. **NO automatic ExitBootServices** unless explicitly testing it.

6. **Sparse image creation:**
   ```bash
   dd if=/dev/zero of=image.img bs=1M count=0 seek=512M
   ```

### Build Verification

After building images, verify:

```bash
# File size (should be 512M)
ls -lh rustica-live-amd64-0.1.0.img

# Disk usage (sparse file should be small)
du -h rustica-live-amd64-0.1.0.img

# Partition table (should be GPT)
fdisk -l rustica-live-amd64-0.1.0.img

# EFI directory structure (when mounted)
find /mnt -name "BOOTX64.EFI"
find /mnt -name "kernel.efi"
```

- Using any computer as your own
- Having a backup system that keeps your settings

## Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually without the interactive installer:

```bash
# Mount the image
sudo mkdir /mnt/rustica
sudo mount -o loop rustica-live-amd64-0.1.0.img /mnt/rustica

# Run the installer directly
sudo /mnt/rustica/bin/rustux-install --device /dev/sdX --yes
```

## System Requirements

### AMD64 (Current)
- **Architecture**: x86_64 (AMD64)
- **RAM**: 512 MB minimum, 1 GB recommended
- **Storage**: 4 GB minimum for installation
- **Boot**: UEFI (recommended) or Legacy BIOS support

### ARM64 (Coming Soon)
- **Architecture**: AArch64 (ARM64)
- **RAM**: 1 GB minimum, 2 GB recommended
- **Storage**: 4 GB minimum for installation
- **Boot**: UEFI required

### RISC-V (Coming Soon)
- **Architecture**: riscv64gc

- **Boot**: UEFI required

## Troubleshooting

### USB won't boot

- Ensure your USB drive is at least 4 GB
- Try reformatting the USB before writing
- Verify the SHA256 checksum
- Try a different USB port or drive
- Check that UEFI boot is enabled in BIOS

### Installation fails

- Ensure you're running as root: `sudo rustux-install`
- Check that target device is correct
- Verify you have enough disk space
- Try with `--yes` flag for automated mode

### Can't detect USB device

- Run: `lsblk` to list all block devices
- Check USB is properly connected
- Try a different USB port

## Multi-Architecture Support

The Rustux kernel supports three architectures, but currently only AMD64 bootable images are available. ARM64 and RISC-V images require a native UEFI bootloader that's currently under development.
